# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This is my first fully functioning Ruby on Rails site.
Some of its features are below:
    
    User Authentication using Devise (which includes Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out, Password Recovery, Password Changing, and Profile Editing)
    
    CRUD Functionality
    
    Each individual User gets their own friends list using Rails Associations functionality for the Database
    
    Database funtionality using SQLite3
    
    Bootstrap for its styling
